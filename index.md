# FIAAS

FIAAS is a system that adds PaaS like functionality on top of Kubernetes.

FIAAS provides abstractions for specifying applications and what is required for
them to run in a given infrastructure.  These abstractions provide the ability
to separate concerns where application developers can provide a specification
for their applications and cluster operators can provide specification
describing the underlying infrastructure hosting the applications. FIAAS enables
integration of applications with the underlying infrastructure and adapts and
applies changes to both applications and the infrastructure transparently. This
allows for seamless reconfiguration and redeployment of all applications if the
underlying infrastructure is changed and enables applications to be deployed and
run on infrastructures that are not described or specified in the application.
This means that an application can be deployed to two very different Kubernetes
clusters, and still work. In this case, FIAAS acts like an “Interface”, defining
how the connection should look, and the cluster provides the implementation of
that “Interface”.

FIAAS has built-in default application configuration options that will apply to
all applications being deployed. This is used for driving applications
towards a common convention and standardization that is sensible. These options
have built-in defaults but can be adjusted or overwritten as needed on a per
application basis.

FIAAS is designed with continous delivery in mind and enables connecting
continuous integration systems with kubernetes clusters for deploying updated
versions of applications as they become available.

## Getting Started

Add the FIAAS helm repository

```
helm repo add fiaas https://fiaas.github.io/helm
```

Install [fiaas-deploy-daemon](https://github.com/fiaas/fiaas-deploy-daemon) the
default namespace with the default configuration.

```
helm install fiaas-deploy-daemon fiaas/fiaas-deploy-daemon
```

In practice you will most likely want to change some of the configuration flags
or deploy to a different (or multiple) namespaces. To do this, take a look at
the [operator
guide](https://github.com/fiaas/fiaas-deploy-daemon/blob/master/docs/operator_guide.md),
and check the values for the helm chart for how to change the configuration.

Now there is a Deploy Daemon running in the default namespace.
Deploy Daemon will create a custom resource definition called Application that
contains the specification for a given application.
Deploy Daemon will watch for new and changed Application resources and
provision kubernetes resources as needed.

Since Deploy Daemon has many of the defaults built in application
specifications can be quite simple but defaults can be overwritten as needed. A
basic application spec can look as simple as this:

```
version: 3
```

Specifying only the version implies that only defaults should be used. This
example overwrites some of the defaults:

```
version: 3
healthchecks:
  liveness:
    http:
      path: /_/health
ingress:
- host: hello-world.ingress.local
ports:
- target_port: 5000
replicas:
  maximum: 1
  minimum: 1
```

The application spec needs to be translated into a kubernetes manifest before
it can be applied to the cluster. Generally developers would provide the
application spec as an artifact from the output of their build and use some
utility for generating a kubernetes manifest from it that can then be applied
directly. [Mast](https://github.com/fiaas/mast) is a reference implementation
for generating application manifests and can be used in a continuous
integration setup. It has integration with Artifactory for obtaining
application spec artifacts that it is then able to transform into a manifest.

The manifest can then be applied directly to the cluster

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: fiaas.schibsted.io/v1
kind: Application
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hello-world
    fiaas/deployment_id: 8898f334-e6b0-4212-9ac4-c0b2bd8ce74e
  name: hello-world
  namespace: default
spec:
  application: hello-world
  config:
    healthchecks:
      liveness:
        http:
          path: /_/health
    ingress:
    - host: hello-world.ingress.local
    ports:
    - target_port: 5000
    replicas:
      maximum: 1
      minimum: 1
    version: 3
  image: fiaas-test-app:latest
EOF
```

Now the Deploy Daemon will pick up the application resource and create the
required Kubernetes resources such as replicaset, service, ingress etc. as
specified by the application specification. The application is now available on
hello-world.ingress.local.

The [v3 application
spec](https://github.com/fiaas/fiaas-deploy-daemon/blob/master/docs/v3_spec.md)
contains more information about the different configuration options that can be
expressed through the application specification.

## Components

[Deploy Daemon](https://github.com/fiaas/fiaas-deploy-daemon) is the main
component of FIAAS that will continuously look for application descriptions and
apply them, effectively deploying applications and provisioning the necessary
kubernetes resources that it requires.

[Mast](https://github.com/fiaas/mast) can be used for generating the necessary
manifest that can be applied to the cluster. The manifest includes an
application resource that the Deploy Daemon will deploy. Mast has endpoints that
can be consumed by CI systems in combination with Kubernetes api.

## Documentation

[k8s](https://k8s.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a python client library for the
Kubernetes api developed by the maintainers of FIAAS.

## Contributing

We are happy to accept pull requests that fix bugs or introduce new features!

Before contributing it might be useful to take a look at the [governance
model](https://github.com/fiaas/governance/blob/master/governance_model.md) to get an understanding of how this
project is managed. You should also review the [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/fiaas/governance/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) which all participants in FIAAS projects
are expected to adhere to.

If you have found a bug or or want to propose a new feature, please submit a Github issue on the appropriate
repository. If you are unsure which repo is appropriate,
[fiaas-deploy-daemon](https://github.com/fiaas/fiaas-deploy-daemon) might be the best choice.

If you want to contribute code, we are also happy to take pull requests, but for non-trivial patches we recommend
creating a Github issue first to make it easier to discuss the proposed changes.

Each repository will also have a README and/or CONTRIBUTING file that will also contain useful information for
potential contributors.
